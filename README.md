# Building a Job Application Management App with React
This project aims to create a react web application for managing job applications. It provides functionalities to create new job applications, track their statuses, add notes, and store links for easy reference.

## Step 1: Setup

1. **Initialize React Project**:
   - Use Create React App to create a new project.
   - Open your terminal and run `npx create-react-app job-application-app`.
   - Navigate into the project directory with `cd job-application-app`.

2. **Project Structure**:
   - Inside the `src` directory, create folders for components, pages, utils, etc.
   - For example:
     ```
     src/
     ├── components/
     ├── pages/
     ├── utils/
     ├── App.js
     └── index.js
     ```

## Step 2: Create Components

1. **Job Application Form**:
   - Create a `JobApplicationForm.js` component in the `components` directory.
   - Design a form with input fields for job application details such as status, due date, meeting time, notes, and link.

2. **Job Application List**:
   - Create a `JobApplicationList.js` component to display all job applications.
   - Iterate over the list of job applications and render `JobApplicationItem` component for each application.

3. **Job Application Item**:
   - Create a `JobApplicationItem.js` component to display individual job application details.
   - Include options to update job application status, view details, and delete.

4. **Job Application Detail**:
   - Create a `JobApplicationDetail.js` component to display detailed information about a job application.
   - Show status, due date, meeting time, notes, and link.

5. **Header and Footer**:
   - Create `Header.js` and `Footer.js` components for navigation and branding.

## Step 3: Define State Management

1. **State Structure**:
   - Determine the structure of your state to manage job applications and their details.
   - For example, you might have an array of job applications, each containing fields for status, due date, meeting time, etc.

2. **Use React State and Hooks**:
   - Inside relevant components, use the `useState` hook to manage component-level state.
   - Initialize state variables and update them as needed.

## Step 4: Implement CRUD Operations

1. **Create Operations**:
   - Write a function to create new job applications.
   - Update the state with the new job application.

2. **Read Operations**:
   - Implement functions to retrieve and display job applications.
   - Use the state to render job applications in the UI.

3. **Update Operations**:
   - Write functions to update job application details (status, due date, etc.).
   - Update the state with the modified job application.

4. **Delete Operations**:
   - Implement functions to delete job applications.
   - Remove the deleted application from the state.

## Step 5: Implement Job Application Features

1. **Forms**:
   - In the `JobApplicationForm` component, handle form submission to create or edit job applications.
   - Validate form inputs and update state accordingly.

2. **Status Updates**:
   - Implement functionality to update job application status.
   - Provide options to change status between Applied, Project, Interview, Rejected, and Approved.

3. **Due Dates and Meeting Times**:
   - Use date and time pickers in the form to set due dates and meeting times.
   - Update state with the selected dates and times.

4. **Notes and Links**:
   - Allow users to add notes and store links related to job applications.
   - Update the state with notes and links.

## Step 6: Implement Bonus Features

1. **Views**:
   - Implement different views for job applications, such as list view and detailed view.
   - Update UI components to switch between views.

2. **Storing Links**:
   - Add a field in the job application form to input and display links related to the application.
   - Save links to the state along with other job application details.

3. **Adding Notes**:
   - Include a text area in the job application detail view for adding/editing notes.
   - Update the state with the entered notes.

## Step 7: Styling

1. **CSS**:
   - Style components using CSS or preprocessors like SCSS.
   - Apply consistent styling across the application for a cohesive look and feel.

2. **Responsive Design**:
   - Use media queries to ensure the app is responsive and looks good on various screen sizes.
   - Test the app on different devices to ensure proper responsiveness.

3. **Accessibility**:
   - Follow accessibility best practices such as using semantic HTML elements and providing appropriate alt text for images.
   - Ensure focus states and keyboard navigation are accessible.
